# AGENTS.md

This document serves as the master guidelines file for AI Agents operating in this repository. It combines project-specific context, security rules, and Laravel Boost best practices.

## 1. Project Context & Architecture

- This repository is a Laravel backend API template.
- The installed dependency set in `composer.lock` currently includes Laravel `v13.x` (or `v12.x`), Laravel Passport `v13.x`, Laravel Boost, Laravel Pint, and PHPUnit `v11.x`. (Treat `composer.json` as the source of truth).
- API routes live under `routes/api.php`, with the main pattern using `/api/v1/...`, `CheckApiToken`, and `auth:api` where required.
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new top-level folders or change architecture patterns without approval.
- Keep controllers thin. Existing API controllers extend `App\Http\Controllers\BaseApiController` and delegate business logic to services.
- Put reusable data operations in services. Existing services extend `App\Services\BaseService`.
- Use API resources for response data where the existing endpoint pattern does so.

## 2. Database & Eloquent Conventions (CRITICAL)

- **Mandatory Table Prefixes**: Every table name MUST begin with the approved system prefix (`me_` for Master Entity, `tb_` for Transaction Base, `st_` for Setup/Static, `mg_` for Management).
- **Format**: All table names must be written in lowercase `snake_case`.
- **Eloquent Binding**: When creating or modifying Eloquent Models, you MUST explicitly define the `$table` property with the prefixed table name.
- **Validation Rules (FormRequests)**: NEVER hardcode string table names (e.g., `unique:me_users,email`). ALWAYS use the Eloquent Model class natively via `Rule::unique(User::class, 'email')` or `Rule::exists(Role::class, 'id')`.
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Avoid `DB::` facade when `Model::query()` can be used. Prevent N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all attributes previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped.
- Casts should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property.

## 3. Security & Authentication

- **User Enumeration**: Do NOT implement custom validation rules (like `UserExists`) that explicitly reveal whether a user exists during authentication. Rely on `Auth::attempt` to fail cleanly and return a generic `auth.failed` message.
- Use Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include validation rules and custom error messages if needed.
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum/Passport, etc.).
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## 4. Code Style & PHP Rules

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single lines.
- Use explicit PHP return types and parameter types for all methods and functions.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`. Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks with useful array shape type definitions over inline code comments. Keep comments sparse; add them only for very complex logic.
- Enums should use TitleCase keys (e.g., `FavoritePerson`).
- Use ASCII unless an edited file already uses another character set for a clear reason.

## 5. Testing And Verification (CRITICAL PROMPT WORKFLOW)

- **Mandatory Verification**: Before concluding *every* prompt or task, you MUST run the following three commands to guarantee codebase stability:
  1. `vendor/bin/pint --test`
  2. `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --error-format=github`
  3. `php artisan test`
- This application uses **PHPUnit** exclusively. Convert any Pest tests to PHPUnit. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}`.
- Run the minimal relevant test set using `php artisan test --filter=testName` during development, but always run the full suite at the end.
- **Spatie Permissions in Tests**: Guarded permissions (e.g., `guard_name => 'api'`) require explicit lookup via `Permission::whereIn('name', [...])->get()` when assigning to models in tests to avoid `PermissionDoesNotExist` exceptions.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases. When creating models for tests, use factories and check for custom states.
- Do not remove tests or test files without explicit approval.
- Format changed PHP files before finalizing edits using `vendor/bin/pint --dirty`.

## 6. Commands

- Install PHP dependencies: `composer install`
- Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the app/dev stack: `composer run dev`
- Build frontend assets when needed: `npm run build`
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input.

## 7. Laravel Boost & Ecosystem

- This project includes **Laravel Boost**. Use Boost MCP tools for Laravel-specific work.
- **`search-docs`** (Critically Important): Use this tool to get version-specific documentation before falling back to other approaches. Search docs before making code changes to ensure the correct approach.
- **`list-artisan-commands`**: Use this to double-check available parameters for Artisan commands.
- **`tinker` & `database-query`**: Use these tools for targeted debugging or querying instead of creating temporary scripts.
- **`browser-logs`**: Read frontend logs, errors, and exceptions. Ignore old logs.
- **`get-absolute-url`**: Use this tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain, and port when sharing a project URL.

## 8. Codex Skills

### skill-creator
- Use `/home/filip/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md` when creating or updating Codex skills. Read the full `SKILL.md` before acting.
- Keep skill instructions concise and focused on non-obvious procedural knowledge. Validate completed skill folders with the skill validation script.

### skill-installer
- Use `/home/filip/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md` when the user asks to list, install, or update Codex skills from curated sources or GitHub.
- The installer scripts require network access, so request escalation when running them in a restricted sandbox. After installing, tell the user to restart Codex.

## 9. Git And Workspace Safety

- The working tree may contain user edits. Inspect `git status --short` before editing.
- Do not revert or overwrite changes you did not make.
- Avoid destructive commands such as `git reset --hard` or broad deletes unless the user explicitly requests them.
- Keep edits scoped to the user request.
